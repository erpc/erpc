# Upstreams

An upstream is defined to handle 1 or more networks (a.k.a. chains). There are currently these types are upstreams:

- [`evm`](#evm) A generic EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint. This is the deault and most-used type.
- [`evm-alchemy`](#alchemy) A special upstream type that accepts Alchemy API-KEY and automatically adds all their EVM chains.
- [`erpc`](#erpc) A special upstream type that is another remote eRPC instance.


## `evm` Upstreams

These are generic well-known EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints. This is the deault and most-used type. They can be your own self-hosted nodes, or remote 3rd-party provider nodes.
