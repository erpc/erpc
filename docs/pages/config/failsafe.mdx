# Failsafe

There are various policies you can use either on [Upstream](/config/projects/upstreams)-level or [Network](/config/projects/networks)-level, to help with intermittent issues and increase general resiliency.

- [`timeout:`](/failsafe/timeout) helps prevent requests from hanging indefinitely.
- [`retry:`](/failsafe/retry) is used to recover transient issues.
- [`hedge:`](/failsafe/hedge) might run simultaneous requests when one upstream is too slow to respond.
- [`circuitBreaker:`](/failsafe/circuit-breaker) temporarily removes a down upstream until it recovers.

Config source code: [common/config.go](https://github.com/erpc/erpc/blob/main/common/config.go#L103-L133)

## `timeout` policy

This policy simply sets a timeout for the request, either on Network-level (when requests are sent to eRPC), or on Upstream-level (when requests are sent to a specific upstream).

These errors will be retried:

- `5xx` and generally any error that indicate server-side (intermittent) issues.
- `408` which means request timeout.
- `429` which means rate limit exceeded, therefore retrying after few moments.
- `EmptyResponse` for certain methods (e.g. eth_getLogs) if upstream A returns empty array, it could be due to lag in node syncing, so upstream B will be retried.

These errors will not be retried:

- `4xx` and generally any error that indicate client-side issues (invalid request, invalid parameters, etc).
- `UnsupportedMethods` which means upstream does not support certain methods (e.g. eth_traceTransaction)

## `hedge` policy

When a request towards an upstream is slow, the `hedge` policy will start a new simultaneous request towards the next upstream.

<Callout type="info">
  This policy is highly recommended to be set at least on network-level. It will
  ensure if upstream A is slow, a new request towards upstream B will be
  started, whichever responds faster will be returned to the client.

## `circuitBreaker` policy

When upstreams are constantly failing, the `circuitBreaker` policy will temporarily remove them from list of available upstreams.

<Callout type="info">
  This policy is recommended to be set on upstream-level. This will make sure
  temporarily broken upstreams are not used, and will give them time to recover.

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />
- [ ] Allow defining failsafe policies on a per-method basis (e.g. different behavior for eth_getLogs vs other methods).
