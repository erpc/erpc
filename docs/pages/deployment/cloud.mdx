# Hosted cloud

To avoid DevOps overhead, and optimal caching storage costs you can request a hosted cloud solution in your preferred infrastrcutre region.

Available regions include but not limited to:
* `EU` close to AWS's eu-central-1 or Hetzner's EU region
* `US` close to AWS's us-east-1 or Hetzner's US region

### Pricing

| Feature | Unit cost / month |
| --- | --- |
| Compute instance(s) | $50 per 2vCPU+4GB RAM |
| Cache data storage | $0.3 per 1GB  |

As an example LiFi project on Arbitrum chain caches 10m transactions and traces, 200m blocks, which results in ~400GB of storage:

- 1 x instance = $50 / mo
- 400 GB x cached data = $100 / mo
