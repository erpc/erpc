# Railway installation

[Railway](https://railway.app) provides a quick and easy way to deploy eRPC. To get started, please ensure that you have signed up or logged in to Railway and connected your GitHub account.

<Steps>

### Deploy

Click the `Deploy on Railway` button below to get started. This will take you to our eRPC template, which includes proxy and monitoring services.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/10iW1q)

<Callout type="info">
  This template comes with a default [erpc.yaml](/config/projects/providers#repository) configuration that will give you access to 2,000+ chains and 4,000+ public free EVM RPC endpoints.
</Callout>

### Config customizaiton 

<Callout type="warning">
  **Frontend / browser usage?** If you plan to consume eRPC from a frontend (e.g browser), be sure to set up 
  the appropriate CORS headers in your [erpc.yaml](/config/projects/cors#config) configuration. 
</Callout>

  If you need further [customization](/config/example#full-config-example), you can fork the [template's repository](https://github.com/erpc/railway-deployment). E.g. you can create an `erpc.yaml` file in your forked repository to add your own premium RPC endpoints, caching, customised network or upstream level failsafe configs, etc. 

  After forking and adjustments, you can either connect your forked repository to your existing deployment or create a new service linked to this forked repository.

### Usage in your services

If your backend services (like indexers or MEV bots) are on the same Railway project as eRPC, you can reduce cost and overhead by using private networking (`.railway.internal`) to connect:

```js
const result = await fetch("https://my-erpc.railway.internal/main/evm/1", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    method: "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    params: ["0x1203319", false],
    id: 9199,
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
  }),
});
```

If you need external access or your services are hosted elsewhere, use the public URL found under `Settings > Networking > Public Networking` in your eRPC service:

### Monitoring

After sending more requests, click on `monitoring` service and find your Grafana url under `Settings > Networking > Public Networking`

You can login with the following credentials:

- username: `admin`
- password: `admin`

Send more requests and watch the metrics being collected and visualized in Grafana.
