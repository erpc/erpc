# Networks

A network represents a chain (e.g., evm, solana, etc), and it is a logical grouping of upstreams.

<Callout type='info'>
  [Upstreams](/config/projects/upstreams) are configured separately, and on the first request to a network, the eRPC will automatically find any upstream that support that network.
</Callout>

You can configure failover behavior per network as follows:

<Tabs items={["yaml", "typescript"]} defaultIndex={0} storageKey="GlobalConfigTypeTabIndex">
  <Tabs.Tab>
```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
projects:
  - id: main

    # (OPTIONAL) This array configures network-specific (a.k.a chain-specific) features.
    # For each network "architecture" and corresponding network id (e.g. evm.chainId) is required.
    # You don't need to define networks as they will be automatically detected from configured endpoints (lazy-loaded).
    # Only provide network list if you want to customize features such as failsafe policies, rate limit budget, finality depth, etc.
    networks:
      - architecture: evm
        # (OPTIONAL) When "evm" is used, "chainId" is required, so that rate limit budget or failsafe policies are properly applied.
        evm:
          # (REQUIRED) chainId is required when "evm" architecture is used.
          chainId: 1
          # (OPTIONAL) fallbackFinalityDepth is optional and allows to manually set a finality depth in case upstream does not support eth_getBlockByNumber(finalized).
          # In case this fallback is used, finalized block will be 'LatestBlock - fallbackFinalityDepth'.
          # Defining this fallback helps with increasing cache-hit rate and reducing redundant 'retry' attempts on empty responses, as we know which data is finalized.
          # DEFAULT: auto-detect - via eth_getBlockByNumber(finalized).

## Default config and lazy-loading

Networks are lazy-loaded on first request for a network (if not explicitly defined in config). You can configure "networkDefaults" to set default values for all networks (both static or lazy-loaded):

### Architectures

#### `evm`

This type of network are generic EVM-based chains that support JSON-RPC protocol.

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />
- [ ] Add support for more architectures (Solana, etc)
