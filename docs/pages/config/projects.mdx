# Projects

A single instance of eRPC can be used for various projects, any number of chains, and any number of upstreams.

You can have separate `backend`, `indexer` and `frontend` projects, so that you control self-imposed rate-limits, or supported methods. This allows you to decide different **"cost"** vs **"reliability"** strategies for each project.

## Config

The `projects:` array is the top-most configuration, and it is required to have at least 1 project. Each project has the following properties:

- `id:` a unique identifier used in logs and metrics.
- [`rateLimitBudget:`](/config/rate-limiters) a budget for the total number of requests that this project is allowed to serve.
- [`networks:`](/config/projects/networks) an array of custom configuration for one or more of the supported networks.
- [`networkDefaults:`](/config/projects/networks#config-defaults) default configuration for all networks in this project.
- [`upstreams:`](/config/projects/upstreams) an array of all upstreams to use in this project.
- [`upstreamDefaults:`](/config/projects/upstreams#config-defaults) default configuration for all upstreams in this project.

#### Example

Refer to [`erpc.yaml`](/config/example) and "projects" section.
