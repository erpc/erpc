### `evmJsonRpcCache`

This feature defines the destination for caching JSON-RPC calls towards any EVM architecture upstream.
Caching mechanism is non-blocking on critical path, and is used as best-effort. If the database is not available, the cache set/get will be skipped.

<Callout type="info">
By default, eRPC enables an in-memory cache with these policies:
- `finalized` data: cached forever with 100k max items and 1mb max item size.
- `unknown` and `unfinalized` data: cached for 30 seconds to be reorg safe yet reduce redundant RPC calls.
</Callout>

#### Cache policies

You can create multiple policies to define different caching behavior for different networks, methods, finality state, emptyish checks, and item size limits.

* On each cache "set" operation all policies that match the network/method/finality state will be used to store the data.
* On each cache "get" operation all policies that match the network/method will be used to retrieve the data, from top to bottom as defined in the config, the first policy that returns a cache hit will be used.

#### Policy matching

Each policy can define matching rules for:

The parameter matcher supports:

* **Wildcards**: Use `*` to match any value
* **OR operator**: Use `|` to specify multiple valid values
* **Numeric comparisons**: For hex/decimal numbers:
  * `>value` - Greater than
  * `>=value` - Greater than or equal
  * `<value` - Less than  
  * `<=value` - Less than or equal
* **Object matching**: For nested parameter objects (like in eth_getLogs), you can specify matchers for individual fields
* **Array matching**: For array parameters, each element can have its own matcher
* **Empty values**: Use `<empty>` to match null/undefined values

#### `finality` states

The cache system recognizes three finality states:

- `finalized`: (default) Data from blocks that are confirmed as finalized (safe to cache long-term). This is based on 'finalized' block fetched via eth_getBlockByNumber of the upstream corresponding to the received response (not other upstreams).
- `unfinalized`: Data from recent blocks that could still be reorged. Also any data/transaction from pending blocks is considered unfinalized.
- `unknown`: When block number cannot be determined from request/response (e.g., `eth_traceTransaction`). Most often it is safe to cache this data without reorg safety because they are not referenced by final actual blocks (e.g. eth_getTransactionByHash).

#### `empty` states

The cache can match three empty states:

- `ignore`: (default) Ignore empty responses and do not cache them.
- `allow`: Allow caching empty responses as well.
- `only`: Only cache empty responses, e.g. if you want to give different TTL.

These values are considered empty:

- `null` for example for a non-existent block
- `[]` (empty array) for example for an empty array from eth_getLogs
- `{}` (empty object) for example when trace results is empty
- `0x` (empty hex) for example for an empty string from eth_getCode or eth_call

#### Re-org mechanism

The cache system provides mechanisms to handle blockchain reorganizations (re-orgs) through the finality state matchers and TTL settings. Here are the key strategies:

1. **Finalized data caching**
   - Use the `finality: finalized` matcher for data that is confirmed and safe from re-orgs
   - This data can be cached with long or infinite TTL (`ttl: 0`)
   - Example: Historical block data, old transaction receipts

2. **Unfinalized data caching**
   - Use `finality: unfinalized` for recent blocks that could be re-orged
   - Set short TTL values (10-30 seconds recommended)
   - Example: Recent blocks, pending transactions
   ```yaml
   - network: "*"
     method: "eth_getBlockByNumber"
     finality: unfinalized
     connector: memory-cache
     ttl: 30s
   ```

3. **Mixed strategy example**
   You can combine multiple policies for the same method:
   ```yaml
   policies:
     # Cache finalized blocks forever
     - network: "*"
       method: "eth_getBlockByNumber"
       finality: finalized
       connector: postgres-cache
       ttl: 0
     
     # Cache unfinalized blocks briefly
     - network: "*"
       method: "eth_getBlockByNumber"
       finality: unfinalized
       connector: memory-cache
       ttl: 30s
   ```

This approach is useful for various scenarios:
- Caching gas estimates briefly to reduce RPC calls
- Temporarily storing `eth_blockNumber` results
- Balancing between performance and data consistency

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to properly test your dApps/indexer full flow to ensure unfinalized data caching works as expected.
</Callout>

For chains which do not support "finalized" block method, eRPC will consider last 1024 blocks unfinalized. This number can be configured via `network.evm.fallbackFinalityDepth`.

#### Cacheable methods
Methods are cached if they include a `blockNumber` or `blockHash` in the request or response, allowing cache invalidation during blockchain reorgs.
If no blockNumber is present, caching is still viable if the method returns data unaffected by reorgs, like `eth_chainId`, or if the data won't change after a reorg, such as `eth_getTransactionReceipt`.
Here is an overview of cacheable methods:

| Method Name                               | Description                                                                               |
