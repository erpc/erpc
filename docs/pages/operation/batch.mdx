# Batch requests

eRPC automatically batches requests towards upstreams which support it. Additionally you can send batched requests (an array of multiple requests) to eRPC itself.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘‹">
  Most often json-rpc batching for EVM is [anti-pattern](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/quicknode-products/apis/guide-to-efficient-rpc-requests#avoid-batching-multiple-rpc-requests), as it increases resource consumption without significant benefits:
  - All requests will be as slow as the slowest request inside the batch.
  - JSON handling will be more expensive causing memory spikes and OOM errors.
  - Handling partial failures will be burdensome for the client (status code is always 200 OK).
  - Many 3rd-party providers (Alchemy, Infura, etc) charge based on number of method calls, not actual requests.
  - When running eRPC in private network locally close to your services, overhead of many single requests is negligible.
</Callout>

### How it works?

* When an upstream is configured to support batching, eRPC will accumulate as many requests as possible for that upstream, even if you send many single requests.
* Batching mechanism respects other aspects of eRPC such as allowed/ignored methods, rate limits, supported/unsupported methods, therefore one huge batch request might be split into smaller ones depending on the most efficient distribution among upstreams.
* Requests will be handled separately (or in mini-batches) and at the end results will be merged back together.
* Response status code will always be `200 OK` because there might be a mix of successful and failed requests.
* At the moment self-imposed rate limiters work as-if these requests are sent individually (Ping our engineers if this becomes an issue).

<Callout type="info">
  Even if you send many single requests to eRPC they might be batched together if the upstream supports it. This minimizes the need to actually batch the requests on client-side, unless "network traffic" is a concern.

  In this scenario auto-batching mechanism is transparent to you.

## Upstream config

You can explicitly enable batching for an upstream as follows:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    upstreams:
      - id: blastapi-chain-42161
        # ...
        endpoint: https://arbitrum-one.blastapi.io/xxxxxx
        jsonRpc:
          # When enabled eRPC will wait for a specified amount of time to batch as many requests as possible.
          supportsBatch: true
          # The maximum amount of time to wait to collect requests for a batch.
          batchMaxWait: 100ms
          # The maximum amount of requests in a single batch, which is usually enforced by the provider.
          batchMaxSize: 100
```

<Callout type="info">
  For certain known providers (Alchemy, Infura, etc) batching is enabled by default.
</Callout>

### Example single chain

When all the requests are for the same chain, you can send them to the URL that includes chain id.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '[
    {
        "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
        "params": [
            "0x1203318888888888",
            false
        ],
        "id": 8888,
        "jsonrpc": "2.0"
    },
    {
        "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
        "params": [
            "0x1203319",
            false
        ],
        "id": 9999,
        "jsonrpc": "2.0"
    }
]'
```

### Example multi-chain

You can provide "networkId" within each request to specify which chain it is for by sending the request to project endpoint:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '[
    {
        "networkId": "evm:1",
        "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
        "params": [
            "0x1203888",
            false
        ],
        "id": 888,
        "jsonrpc": "2.0"
    },
    {
        "networkId": "evm:42161",
        "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
        "params": [
            "0x1203999",
            false
        ],
        "id": 999,
        "jsonrpc": "2.0"
    }
]'
```

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />
- [ ] Auto-batch multiple `eth_call`s for evm upstreams using multicall3 contracts if available on that chain.
