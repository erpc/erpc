# Healthcheck

eRPC has a built-in `/healthcheck` endpoint that can be used to check the health of the service within Kubernetes, Railway, etc.

## Config

You can configure healthcheck on top-level in `erpc.yaml` file:

```yaml
logLevel: debug
healthCheck:
  # (OPTIONAL) Mode can be "simple" (just returns OK/ERROR) or "verbose" (returns detailed JSON)
  mode: verbose
  
  # (OPTIONAL) Default evaluation strategy to use when one isn't specified in the request
  # See the "Evaluation Strategies" section below for options...
  defaultEval: "any:initializedUpstreams"
  
  # (OPTIONAL) Authentication for the healthcheck endpoint
  auth:
    strategies:
      - type: secret
        secret:
          value: <CHANGE-ME-OR-REMOVE-THIS-STRATEGY>
      - type: network
        network:
          # To allow requests coming from the same host (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1)
          allowLocalhost: true
          # To allow requests coming from private networks
          allowedCIDRs:
          - "10.0.0.0/8"
          - "172.16.0.0/12"
          - "192.168.0.0/16"
```

## Evaluation Strategies

The healthcheck endpoint supports different strategies to evaluate the health of your upstreams. You can specify the strategy in the configuration or by adding `?eval=strategy_name` to the URL.

Available strategies:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `any:initializedUpstreams` | Returns healthy if any upstreams are initialized (default) |
| `any:errorRateBelow90` | Returns healthy if any upstream has an error rate below 90% |
| `all:errorRateBelow90` | Returns healthy if all upstreams have an error rate below 90% |
| `any:errorRateBelow100` | Returns healthy if any upstream has an error rate below 100% |
| `all:errorRateBelow100` | Returns healthy if all upstreams have an error rate below 100% |
| `any:evm:eth_chainId` | Returns healthy if any EVM upstream reports the expected chain ID |
| `all:evm:eth_chainId` | Returns healthy if all EVM upstreams report the expected chain ID |

* Error rate is read from [score tracking](/config/projects/upstreams#priority--selection-mechanism) component of each Upstream.
* The `eth_chainId` evals will send an actual request to the upstreams (in parallel), thus ensure proper timeout is set for the healthcheck (e.g. on Kubernetes readinessProbe.timeoutSeconds).

## Endpoints

### Global healthcheck
Check the health of all projects and their upstreams:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck -v
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
The global healthcheck checks all active projects and all upstreams. For example even if 1 upstream (on any network) is healthy the `any:initializedUpstreams` strategy will return healthy.
</Callout>

### Project-specific healthcheck
Check the health of a specific project and network:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1/healthcheck -v # OR http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
For project-specific healthchecks, only the upstreams for the specified network are checked.
</Callout>

### Using a custom evaluation strategy

You can specify which evaluation strategy to use via the query parameter:

```bash
# Check if any upstream has an error rate below 90%
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck?eval=any:errorRateBelow90

# Check if all EVM upstreams report the correct chain ID
curl http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1/healthcheck?eval=all:evm:eth_chainId
```

<Callout type="info">
The evaluation strategy can be specified in the [configuration](#config) as well, as shown above.
</Callout>

## Response Modes

### Simple Mode (default)

In simple mode, the healthcheck returns a plain text "OK" with a 200 status code if healthy, or an error JSON with a non-200 status code if unhealthy.

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck
# OK
```

### Verbose Mode

In verbose mode, the healthcheck returns a detailed JSON response with information about the status of each project and upstream:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck
# {
#   "status": "OK",
#   "message": "all systems operational",
#   "details": {
#     "main": {
#       "status": "OK",
#       "message": "3 / 3 upstreams have low error rates",
#       "config": {
#         "networks": 2,
#         "upstreams": 3,
#         "providers": 1
#       },
#       "upstreams": {
#         "alchemy-mainnet": {
#           "network": "evm:1",
#           "metrics": { ... },
#           "status": "OK"
#         },
#         ...
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
```

## Authentication

If you've configured authentication for the healthcheck endpoint, you'll need to include the appropriate credentials:

```bash
# Using a token in a query parameter
curl "http://localhost:4000/healthcheck?secret=CHANGE_ME"

# ... OR using a token in a header
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck -H "X-ERPC-Secret-Token: CHANGE_ME"
```

## Aliasing healthcheck

If you have configured domain aliasing, you can append the `/healthcheck` to the URL:

```bash
# When aliasing is NOT used:
curl http://rpc.example.com/main/evm/42161/healthcheck -v

# When only project is aliased:
curl http://rpc.example.com/evm/42161/healthcheck -v

# When only project and network architecture is aliased:
curl http://evm-rpc.example.com/42161/healthcheck -v

# When all project, network architecture and chain are aliased:
curl http://eth-evm-rpc.example.com/healthcheck -v
```
