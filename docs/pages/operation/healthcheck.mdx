# Healthcheck

eRPC has a built-in `/healthcheck` endpoint that can be used to check the health of the service within Kubernetes, Railway, etc.

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck -v
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
Currently this endpoint checks active projects and their upstreams (i.e. those which received at least 1 request) for total error rate, and it will return a non-200 response if all endpoints have a +99% error rate.
