# Upstreams

An upstream is defined to handle 1 or more networks (a.k.a. chains). There are currently these types of upstreams:

- [`evm`](#evm-json-rpc) A generic EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint. This is the default and most-used type.
- [`alchemy`](#alchemy-json-rpc) A special upstream type that accepts Alchemy API-KEY and automatically adds all their EVM chains.
- [`thirdweb`](#thirdweb-json-rpc) A special upstream type that accepts Thirdweb API-KEY and automatically adds all their EVM chains.
- [`envio`](#envio-json-rpc) A special upstream type for Envio HyperRPC endpoint and automatically adds all chains by HyperRPC.
- [`pimlico`](#pimlico-json-rpc) A special upstream type for Pimlico account-abstraction (ERC-4337) support.
- [`etherspot`](#etherspot-json-rpc) A special upstream type for Etherspot account-abstraction (ERC-4337) support.

<Callout type='info'>
  eRPC supports any EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint when using `evm` type. Specialized types like "evm+alchemy" are built for well-known providers to make it easier to import "all supported evm chains" with just an API-KEY.
</Callout>

## Selection mechanism

eRPC records various metrics about each upstream, and uses them to decide which upstream to use when a request is made. These metrics include:
- **Total request failures** gives higher priority to upstreams with lower failure rate.
- **Total rate limited requests** gives higher priority to upstreams with lower rate limited requests.
- **P90 latency of requests** gives higher priority to upstreams with lower latency.
- **Total requests served** gives higher priority to upstreams with least served requests so they have a chance to prove themselves.

These metrics amount to a certain **Score** per upstream, within a defined `windowSize` (default 30 minutes), which can be configured as:
```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
projects:
  # ...
  - id: main
    # ...
    healthCheck:
      scoreMetricsWindowSize: 1h
      # ...
```

<Callout type='info'>
  Scoring mechanism only affects the order which upstreams are tried. To completely disable a bad upstream, you should use [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/failsafe#circuitbreaker-policy) failsafe policy on upstream-level.
</Callout>

## Config

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...

    # Each upstream supports 1 or more networks (i.e. evm chains)
    upstreams:
      - id: blastapi-chain-42161
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://arbitrum-one.blastapi.io/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx

        # Defines which budget to use when hadnling requests of this upstream (e.g. to limit total RPS)
        # Since budgets can be applied to multiple upstreams they all consume from the same budget.
        # For example "global-blast" below can be applied to all chains supported by BlastAPI,
        # to ensure you're not hitting them more than your account allows.
        rateLimitBudget: global-blast

        # Rate limit budget can be automatically adjusted based on the "rate-limited" error rate,
        # received from upstream. Auto-tuning is enabled by default with values below.
        # This is useful to automatically increase the budget if an upstream is capable of handling more requests,
        # and decrease the budget if upstream is degraded.
        # Every "adjustmentPeriod" total number of requests vs rate-limited will be calculated,
        # if the value (0 to 1) is above "errorRateThreshold" then budget will be decreased by "decreaseFactor",
        # if the value is below "errorRateThreshold" then budget will be increased by "increaseFactor".
        # Note that the new budget will be applied to any upstream using this budget (e.g. Quicknode budget decreases).
        rateLimitAutoTune:
          enabled: true
          adjustmentPeriod: 1m
          errorRateThreshold: 0.1
          increaseFactor: 1.05
          decreaseFactor: 0.9
          minBudget: 0
          maxBudget: 10_000

        # chainId is optional and will be detected from the endpoint (eth_chainId),
        # but it is recommended to set it explicitly, for faster initialization.
        evm:
          chainId: 42161

        # Which methods must never be sent to this upstream.
        # For example this can be used to avoid archive calls (traces) to full nodes
        ignoreMethods:
          - "eth_traceTransaction"
          - "alchemy_*"
        # Explicitly allowed methods will take precedence over ignoreMethods.
        # For example if you only want eth_getLogs to be served, set ignore methods to "*" and allowMethods to "eth_getLogs".
        allowMethods:
          - "eth_getLogs"
        # By default a dynamic mechanism automatically adds "Unsupported" methods to ignoreMethods,
        # based on errors returned by the upstream. Set this to false to disable this behavior.
        autoIgnoreUnsupportedMethods: true

        # Refer to "Failsafe" section for more details:
        failsafe:
          timeout:
            duration: 15s
          retry:
            maxCount: 2
            delay: 1000ms
            backoffMaxDelay: 10s
            backoffFactor: 0.3

## Upstream Types

### `evm` JSON-RPC

These are generic well-known EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints. This is the default and most-used type. They can be your own self-hosted nodes, or remote 3rd-party provider nodes.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: my-infura
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
        evm:
          chainId: 1 # Optional. If this is not set it'll be detected from the endpoint (eth_chainId)
          nodeType: full # Optional. Can be "full" or "archive"
        # ...
```

### `alchemy` JSON-RPC

This upstream type is built specially for [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) 3rd-party provider to make it easier to import "all supported evm chains" with just an API-KEY.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: my-alchemy
        endpoint: alchemy://YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
        # ...
```

### `thirdweb` JSON-RPC

This upstream type is built specially for [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist) 3rd-party provider to make it easier to import "all supported evm chains" with just a CLIENT-ID.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: my-thirdweb
        endpoint: thirdweb://YOUR_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID
        # ...
```

### `envio` JSON-RPC

Envio [HyperRPC](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/hyperrpc-supported-networks) service provides a higher-performance alternative for certain read methods. When handling requests if a [method is supported by HyperRPC](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperSync/overview-hyperrpc), then this upstream may be used.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: envio-public
        endpoint: envio://rpc.hypersync.xyz
        # ...
```

<Callout type='info'>
  For indexing use-cases it is recommended to this upstream. This will automatically add all supported EVM chains by HyperRPC.
</Callout>

### `pimlico` JSON-RPC

[Pimlico](https://pimlico.io) adds account-abstraction (ERC-4337) support to your eRPC instance. With this upstream added when a AA-related request arrives it'll be forwarded to Pimlico, which allows you to use the same RPC endpoint for both usual eth_* methods along with ERC-4337 methods.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: pimlico-public
        endpoint: pimlico://public
        # Or provide your API-KEY as:
        # endpoint: pimlico://xxxxxmy-api-key
        # ...
```

### `etherspot` JSON-RPC

[Etherspot](https://etherspot.io/) adds account-abstraction (ERC-4337) support to your eRPC instance. With this upstream added when a AA-related request arrives it'll be forwarded to Etherspot, which allows you to use the same RPC endpoint for both usual eth_* methods along with ERC-4337 methods.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: etherspot-public
        endpoint: etherspot://public
        # Or provide your API-KEY as:
        # endpoint: etherspot://xxxxxmy-api-key
        # ...
```

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />
- [ ] Add a "exclusiveMethods" to make it easier to configure which
upstreams are only ones supporting certain methods (e.g. alchemy_*)
- [ ]
Automatically detect type of EVM nodes (full, archive) and engines (erigon,
geth, etc)
- [ ] Implement the logic for "getLogsMaxBlockRange" to split
multiple requests when the block range is too high.
- [ ] Add more special types
for well-known vendors (BlastAPI, Ankr, LlamaRPC, etc) for easier multi-chain
support.
