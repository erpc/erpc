# OpenTelemetry Tracing

eRPC includes support for distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. This allows you to track requests as they flow through the system, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug issues in production environments.

## Config

To enable tracing, add the following to your `erpc.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
tracing:
  enabled: true
  endpoint: "localhost:4317"  # OTLP endpoint (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.)
  protocol: "grpc"            # "grpc" or "http"
  samplingRatio: 0.1          # Sample 10% of requests
  tls:
    enabled: false            # Enable TLS for secure connections
    # certFile: "/path/to/cert.pem"
    # keyFile: "/path/to/key.pem"
    # caFile: "/path/to/ca.pem"
server:
 # ...
projects:
 # ...
```

## Using with Jaeger

The included [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/erpc/erpc/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file contains a Jaeger service for visualizing traces. To use it:

1. Start the Jaeger container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up jaeger
   ```

2. Configure eRPC to send traces to Jaeger:
   ```yaml
   tracing:
     enabled: true
     endpoint: "localhost:4317"
     protocol: "grpc"
     samplingRatio: 1.0 # Sample all requests during development
   ```

3. Access the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686

## Traced Components

The following components are instrumented with tracing:

- HTTP server request handling
- Network-level (chain) forwarding
- Upstream-level request forwarding
- Cache operations (get/set)
- Failsafe executor operations (hedges, retries)
- HTTP client requests to upstreams
