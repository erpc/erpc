# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

When using eRPC directly from the browser (i.e., frontend), you might need to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) so that only your domains are allowed to access eRPC endpoints.

## Config

Here's an example of how to configure CORS in your `erpc.yaml` file:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
projects:
  - id: main
    cors:
      # List of allowed origins. Use ["*"] to allow any origin
      allowedOrigins: 
        - "https://example.com"
        - "https://*.example.com"
      # HTTP methods allowed for CORS requests
      allowedMethods: 
        - "GET"
        - "POST"
        - "OPTIONS"
      # Headers allowed in actual requests
      allowedHeaders:
        - "Content-Type"
        - "Authorization"
      # Headers exposed to the browser
      exposedHeaders:
        - "X-Request-ID"
      # Whether the browser should include credentials with requests
      allowCredentials: true
      # How long (in seconds) browsers should cache preflight request results
      maxAge: 3600
    upstreams:
    # ...
rateLimiters:
  # ...
```

#### `allowedOrigins`
- Type: array of strings
- Description: Specifies which origins are allowed to make requests to your eRPC endpoint.
- Example: `["https://example.com", "https://*.example.com"]`
- Use `["*"]` to allow any origin (not recommended for production)

#### `allowedMethods`
- Type: array of strings
- Description: HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resource.
- Example: `["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]`

#### `allowedHeaders`
- Type: array of strings
- Description: Headers that are allowed in actual requests.
- Example: `["Content-Type", "Authorization"]`

#### `exposedHeaders`
- Type: array of strings
- Description: Headers that browsers are allowed to access.
- Example: `["X-Request-ID"]`

#### `allowCredentials`
- Type: boolean
- Description: Indicates whether the request can include user credentials like cookies, HTTP authentication or client side SSL certificates.
- Example: `true`

#### `maxAge`
- Type: integer
- Description: Indicates how long (in seconds) the results of a preflight request can be cached.
- Example: `3600` (1 hour)

## Examples

### Basic Web Application

For a basic web application where you want to allow requests only from your main domain:

```yaml
cors:
  allowedOrigins: 
    - "https://myapp.com"
  allowedMethods: 
    - "GET"
    - "POST"
  allowedHeaders:
    - "Content-Type"
  allowCredentials: false
  maxAge: 300
```

### Multiple Subdomains

If your application spans multiple subdomains:

```yaml
cors:
  allowedOrigins: 
    - "https://*.myapp.com"
  allowedMethods: 
    - "GET"
    - "POST"
    - "PUT"
    - "DELETE"
  allowedHeaders:
    - "Content-Type"
    - "Authorization"
  exposedHeaders:
    - "X-Request-ID"
  allowCredentials: true
  maxAge: 3600
```

### Development Environment

For a development environment where you need more permissive settings:

```yaml
cors:
  allowedOrigins: 
    - "http://localhost:3000"
    - "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
  allowedMethods: 
    - "GET"
    - "POST"
    - "PUT"
    - "DELETE"
    - "OPTIONS"
  allowedHeaders:
    - "*"
  allowCredentials: true
  maxAge: 86400
```
