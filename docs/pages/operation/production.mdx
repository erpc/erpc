# Production guidelines

Here are some recommendations for running eRPC in production.

## Failsafe policies

Make sure to configure [retry policy](/config/failsafe#retry-policy) on both network-level and upstream-level.

- Network-level retry configuration is useful to try other upstreams if one has an issue. Even when only 1 upstream network-level retry is useful. Recommendation is to configure `maxCount` to be equal to the number of upstreams.
- Upstream-level retry configuration covers intermittent issues with a specific upstream. It is recommended to set at least 2 and at most 5 as `maxCount`.

[Timeout policy](/config/failsafe#timeout-policy) depends on the expected response time for your use-case, for example when using "trace" methods on EVM chains, providers might take up to 10 seconds to respond. Therefore a low timeout might ultimately always fail. If you are not using heavy methods such as trace or large getLogs, you can use `3s` as a default timeout.

[Hedge policy](/config/failsafe#hedge-policy) is **highly-recommended** if you prefer "fast response as soon as possible". For example setting `500ms` as "delay" will make sure if upstream A did not respond under 500 milliseconds, simultaneously another request to upstream B will be fired, and eRPC will respond back as soon as any of them comes back with result faster. Note that since more requests are sent it might incur higher costs to achieve the "fast response" goal.

## Caching database

Storing cached RPC responses requires high storage for read-heavy use-cases such as indexing 100m blocks on Arbitrum. eRPC is designed to be robust towards cache database issues, so even if database is compeltely down it will not impact the RPC availability.

As described in [Database](/config/database) section depending on your requirements choose the right type. You can start with Redis which is easiest to setup, and if amount of cached data is larger than available memory you can switch to PostgreSQL.

Using [eRPC cloud](/operation/cloud) solution will be most cost-efficient in terms of caching storage costs, as we'll be able to break the costs over many projects.
