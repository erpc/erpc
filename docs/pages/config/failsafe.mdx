# Failsafe

There are various policies you can use either on [Upstream](/config/projects/upstreams)-level or [Network](/config/projects/networks)-level, to help with intermittent issues and increase general resiliency.

- [`timeout:`](/config/failsafe#timeout-policy) helps prevent requests from hanging indefinitely.
- [`retry:`](/config/failsafe#retry-policy) is used to recover transient issues.
- [`hedge:`](/config/failsafe#hedge-policy) might run simultaneous requests when one upstream is too slow to respond.
- [`circuitBreaker:`](/config/failsafe#circuitbreaker-policy) temporarily removes a down upstream until it recovers.
- [Integrity](/config/failsafe/integrity) module helps increase data quality on certain methods such as getLogs or getBlockByNumber.

## `timeout` policy

This policy simply sets a timeout for the request, either on Network-level (when requests are sent to eRPC), or on Upstream-level (when requests are sent to a specific upstream).

## `retry` policy

This policies will retry certain retryable failures, either on network-level and/or upstream-level.

These errors will be retried:

- `5xx` and generally any error that indicate server-side (intermittent) issues.
- `408` which means request timeout.
- `429` which means rate limit exceeded, therefore retrying after few moments.
- `EmptyResponse` for certain methods (e.g. eth_getLogs) if upstream A returns empty array, it could be due to lag in node syncing, so upstream B will be retried.

These errors will not be retried:

- `4xx` and generally any error that indicate client-side issues (invalid request, invalid parameters, etc).
- `UnsupportedMethods` which means upstream does not support certain methods (e.g. eth_traceTransaction)
## `hedge` policy

When a request towards an upstream is slow, the `hedge` policy will start a new simultaneous request towards the next upstream.

<Callout type="info">
  This policy is highly recommended to be set at least on network-level. It will
  ensure if upstream A is slow, a new request towards upstream B will be
  started, whichever responds faster will be returned to the client.
</Callout>

          },
          failsafe: {
            hedge: {
              // Recommended: Use quantile-based hedging
              quantile: 0.99,

The hedge policy supports two modes:

1. **Quantile-based hedging (recommended)**: Uses per-method response time statistics across all upstreams to determine optimal hedge timing. Set `quantile: 0.99` to hedge after the 99th percentile response time plus `delay`. Use `minDelay` and `maxDelay` to bound the hedge timing. Using quantile-based means eRPC will observe the response time of a specific method (across all upstreams) for a while and then decides what should be the hedge delay. This approach means highest effective ness for this feature and lowest wasted number of resources.

2. **Fixed-delay hedging**: Simply waits for `delay` duration before hedging. This approach might be less effective and wasteful by trigger too many hedges that will be discarded anyway.

You can monitor hedging effectiveness through the `erpc_network_hedged_request_total` and `erpc_network_hedge_discards_total` metrics in the sample [Grafana dashboard](/operation/monitoring):

## `circuitBreaker` policy

When upstreams are constantly failing, the `circuitBreaker` policy will temporarily remove them from list of available upstreams.

<Callout type="info">
  This policy is recommended to be set on upstream-level. This will make sure
  temporarily broken upstreams are not used, and will give them time to recover.

            # These two variables indicate how many successes are required in half-open state before closing the circuit,
            # and putting the upstream back in available upstreams.

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />
- [ ] Allow defining failsafe policies on a per-method basis (e.g. different behavior for eth_getLogs vs other methods).
