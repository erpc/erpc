# URL

eRPC supports several URL patterns for making requests, with options for both single-chain and multi-chain endpoints.

## Single-chain requests

### Standard URL pattern

When making requests only for a single chain, you can use this URL structure:

<Callout type='info'>
  https://&lt;your-erpc-hostname&gt;/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;network-architecture&gt;/&lt;chain-id&gt;
</Callout>

##### `<your-erpc-hostname>`
Depends on your deployment setup, for example in local development (using `make run`) it will be `localhost:4000`.

##### `<project-id>`
Target project ID you configured in [erpc.yaml](/config/example), for example "main" or "frontend", "backend", etc.

##### `<network-architecture>`
Target network architecture you configured in [erpc.yaml](/config/example), for example `evm`.

##### `<chain-id>`
Target chain ID that one or more upstreams support, for example `1` or `42161`.

```bash
# A cURL example of sending a request to a project named "main" and Ethereum mainnet chain:

curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": [
        "0x1203319",
        false
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

### Domain aliasing
If configured with domain aliasing, you can have predefined project and network values:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
server:
  # ...
  aliasing:
    rules:
      - matchDomain: "*" # (OPTIONAL) Pattern to match Host header, defaults to `*` (all domains)
      - serveProject: "main" # (OPTIONAL) Project ID to serve for matched domains
      - serveArchitecture: "evm" # (OPTIONAL) Network architecture (e.g., "evm")
      - serveChain: "1" # (OPTIONAL) Chain ID (e.g., "1" for Ethereum mainnet)
```

#### Configuration examples

- **No aliasing** - full URL is required
```yaml
aliasing: ~
```
```
https://api.myservice.com/main/evm/1
```

- **Project only**
```yaml
server:
  aliasing:
    rules:
      - matchDomain: "api.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
```
```
https://api.myservice.com/evm/1
```

- **Project and architecture**
```yaml
server:
  aliasing:
    rules:
      - matchDomain: "evm.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
        serveArchitecture: "evm"
```
```
https://evm.myservice.com/1
```

- **Full aliasing**
```yaml
server:
  aliasing:
    rules:
      - matchDomain: "eth.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
        serveArchitecture: "evm"
        serveChain: "1"
```
```
https://eth.myservice.com
```

#### Multiple rules example

You can define multiple rules to handle different domains:

```yaml
server:
  aliasing:
    rules:
      # Ethereum Mainnet specific endpoint
      - matchDomain: "eth.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
        serveArchitecture: "evm"
        serveChain: "1"
      
      # Arbitrum specific endpoint
      - matchDomain: "arbitrum.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
        serveArchitecture: "evm"
        serveChain: "42161"
      
      # Generic EVM endpoint (requires chain ID in URL)
      - matchDomain: "evm.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
        serveArchitecture: "evm"
      
      # Project-specific endpoint (requires architecture and chain in URL)
      - matchDomain: "api.myservice.com"
        serveProject: "main"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Alias domains are matched with `Host` header using [matcher syntax](/config/matcher)
</Callout>

## Multi-chain requests

When making requests for multiple chains, you can use the project endpoint only and must include "networkId" within the request body:

<Callout type='info'>
  https://&lt;your-erpc-hostname&gt;/&lt;project-id&gt;
</Callout>


```bash
# A cURL example of sending a request to a project named "main" and Ethereum mainnet chain:

curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "networkId": "evm:1",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": [
        "0x1203319",
        false
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

## Batch requests

You can batch multiple calls across any number of networks, in a single request. Read more about it in [Batch requests](/operation/batch) page.

## Healthcheck

eRPC has a built-in `/healthcheck` endpoint that can be used to check the health of the service within Kubernetes, Railway, etc.

### Global healthcheck
Check the health of all projects and their upstreams:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck -v
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
This endpoint checks active projects and their upstreams (i.e. those which received at least 1 request) for total error rate, and it will return a non-200 response if all endpoints have a +99% error rate.
</Callout>

### Project-specific healthcheck
Check the health of a specific project and network:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1/healthcheck -v
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
The healthcheck endpoints verify active upstreams (i.e. those which received at least 1 request) for total error rate, and will return a non-200 response if all endpoints have a +99% error rate. For project-specific healthchecks, only the upstreams for the specified network are checked.
</Callout>

### Aliasing healthcheck

If you have configured domain aliasing, you can append the `/healthcheck` to the URL:

```bash
# When aliasing is NOT used:
curl http://eth.myapi.com/main/evm/42161/healthcheck -v

# When only project is aliased:
curl http://eth.myapi.com/evm/42161/healthcheck -v

# When only project and network architecture is aliased:
curl http://eth.myapi.com/42161/healthcheck -v

# When all project, network architecture and chain are aliased:
curl http://eth.myapi.com/healthcheck -v
```
