# URL

eRPC supports two endpoints, one for single-chain requests and one for multi-chain requests.

## Single-chain requests

When making requests only for a single chain, you can use this URL structure:

<Callout type='info'>
  https://&lt;your-erpc-hostname&gt;/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;network-architecture&gt;/&lt;chain-id&gt;
</Callout>

##### `<your-erpc-hostname>`
Depends on your deployment setup, for example in local development (using `make run`) it will be `localhost:4000`.

##### `<project-id>`
Target project ID you configured in [erpc.yaml](/config/example), for example "main" or "frontend", "backend", etc.

##### `<network-architecture>`
Target network architecture you configured in [erpc.yaml](/config/example), for example `evm`.

##### `<chain-id>`
Target chain ID that one or more upstreams support, for example `1` or `42161`.


```bash
# A cURL example of sending a request to a project named "main" and Ethereum mainnet chain:

curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": [
        "0x1203319",
        false
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

## Multi-chain requests

When making requests for multiple chains, you can use the project endpoint only and must include "networkId" within the request body:

<Callout type='info'>
  https://&lt;your-erpc-hostname&gt;/&lt;project-id&gt;
</Callout>


```bash
# A cURL example of sending a request to a project named "main" and Ethereum mainnet chain:

curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "networkId": "evm:1",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": [
        "0x1203319",
        false
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'
```

## Batch requests

You can batch multiple calls across any number of networks, in a single request. Read more about it in [Batch requests](/operation/batch) page.

## Healthcheck

eRPC has a built-in `/healthcheck` endpoint that can be used to check the health of the service within Kubernetes, Railway, etc.

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/healthcheck -v
# < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# OK
```

<Callout type="info">
Currently this endpoint checks active projects and their upstreams (i.e. those which received at least 1 request) for total error rate, and it will return a non-200 response if all endpoints have a +99% error rate.
</Callout>
