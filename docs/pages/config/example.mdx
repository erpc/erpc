# Complete config example

This example config demonstrates all features of eRPC in one place. For more explanation of each section, refer to dedicated pages:

- [Database](/config/database): to configure caching and database.
- [Projects](/config/projects): to define multiple projects with different rate limit budgets.
- [Networks](/config/projects/networks): to configure failsafe policies for each network.
- [Upstreams](/config/projects/upstreams): to configure upstreams with failsafe policies, rate limiters, allowed/rejected methods, etc.
- [Rate limiters](/config/rate-limiters): to configure various self-imposed budgets to prevent pressure on upstreams.
- [Failsafe](/config/failsafe): explains different policies such as retry, timeout, and hedges, used for networks and upstreams.

### `erpc.yaml`

By default `erpc` binary will look for `./erpc.yaml` file in the current directory. You can change this path by passing an argument to the binary:

```bash
$ erpc /path/to/your/erpc.yaml
```

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# Log level helps in debugging or error detection:
# - debug: information down to actual request and responses, and decisions about rate-liming etc.
# - info: usually prints happy paths and might print 1 log per request indicating of success or failure.
# - warn: these problems do not cause end-user problems, but might indicate degredataion or an issue such as cache databse being down.
# - error: these are problems that have end-user impact, such as misconfigurations.
logLevel: warn

# There are various use-cases of database in erpc, such as caching, dynamic configs, rate limit persistence, etc.
database:
  # `evmJsonRpcCache` defines the destination for caching JSON-RPC cals towards any EVM architecture upstream.
  # This database is non-blocking on critical path, and is used as best-effort.
  # Make sure the storage requirements meet your usage, for example caching 70m blocks + 10m txs + 10m traces on Arbitrum needs 200GB of storage.
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    # Refer to "Database" section for more details.
    # Note that table, schema and indexes will be created automatically if they don't exist.

# Each project is a collection of networks and upstreams.

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />- [ ] Support a Typescript-based config to allow injecting env variables
and code reusability. - [ ] More advanced validation for the values to prevent
user errors. - [ ] Add healthcheck configuration for error rate, and max allowed
blocked behind allowed for evm upstreams.
