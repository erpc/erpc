### Selection policies

**Selection policy** allows you to influence how upstreams are selected to serve traffic (or not). A selection policy is defined at the network level and is responsible for returning a list of upstreams that must remain active. 

The primary purpose of a selection policy is to define acceptable performance metrics and/or required conditions for selecting an upstream node.
<Callout type='info'>
  Selection policies can be configured to run per-method and network or per-network only. <br />
</Callout>

<Callout type='warning'>
  Selection policies are not executed per request, instead they run on an interval much like a healthcheck and update the available upstreams.
</Callout>

#### Default fallback policy

By default a built-in selection policy is activated if **at least one upstream** is assigned to the "fallback" group. This default policy incorporates basic logic for error rates and block lag, which can be tuned via theese environment variables 

* `ROUTING_POLICY_MAX_ERROR_RATE` (Default: `0.7`): Maximum allowed error rate.
* `ROUTING_POLICY_MAX_BLOCK_HEAD_LAG` (Default: `10`): Maximum allowed block head lag.
* `ROUTING_POLICY_MIN_HEALTHY_THRESHOLD` (Default: `1`): Minimum number of healthy upstreams that must be included in default group.

These environment variables allow you to adjust the default logic without rewriting the policy function.

#### Use cases

- **Block Lag:** Disable upstreams that are lagging behind more than a specified number of blocks until they resync.
- **Error Rate:** Exclude upstreams exceeding a certain error rate and periodically check their status.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Prioritize "cheap" nodes and fallback to "fast" nodes only is all cheap nodes are down.

##### Looking to influence selection ordering?

If you only want to change ordering of upstreams (not entirely exclude them) check out [Scoring multipliers](/config/projects/upstreams#customizing-scores--priorities) docs. Remember selection policy will NOT influence the ordering of upstreams.
