# Directives

To instruct eRPC behavior on a per-request basis, you can provide directive "Headers" based on actual use-case:

* [Retry empty responses](#retry-empty-responses)
* [Retry pending transactions](#retry-pending-transactions)
* [Skip cache read](#skip-cache-read)
* [Cache max age](#cache-max-age)
* [Use specific upstream(s)](#use-specific-upstreams)
* [Validation directives](/config/failsafe/integrity#validations-directives) — Control response validation (bloom filters, receipts, logs)

## Retry empty responses

By default all empty-ish responses will be retried, and only if all upstreams return the same empty response, then client will receive the empty response.

Emptyish means any of these:
* Response is `[]` empty array for example for eth_getLogs
* Response is `null` or `{}` empty object for example for eth_getTransactionReceipt
* Response is `""` or `0x` empty hashed byte, for example for certain eth_call responses

To explicitly disable this behavior for certain requests, you can use either:
* Header `X-ERPC-Retry-Empty: false`
* Or query parameter `?retry-empty=false`

<Callout type="info">
    Empty-response retry behavior only applies when dealing with unfinalized data (recent blocks). For blocks in far past, empty responses are treated as final and won't be retried.
</Callout>

For example when you're requesting eth_getTransactionReceipt of mostly reecent transactions and prefer to immeditely get an empty response and handle it on your client side:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-ERPC-Retry-Empty: false' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params": [
        "0xe014f359cb3988f9944cd8003aac58812730383041993fdf762efcee21172d15",
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'

# OR
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161?retry-empty=false'
# ...
```

You can set this directive on network-wide configuration so that it applies to all requests:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
projects:
  - id: main
    
    # To apply to all networks in this project:
    networkDefaults:
      directiveDefaults:
        retryEmpty: false # (default: true)
    
    # For a specific network:
    networks:
      - type: evm
        evm:
          chainId: 137
        directiveDefaults:
          retryEmpty: false # (default: true)
```

## Retry pending transactions

By default requests towards pending transactions will be retried until tx is included (blockNumber is not `null`), and fail if even after all retries blockNumber is still null.

This behavior is applied to these methods:
* eth_getTransactionByHash
* eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex
* eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex
* eth_getTransactionReceipt

To disable this behavior, you can use either:
* Header `X-ERPC-Retry-Pending: false`
* Or query parameter `?retry-pending=false`

For example if you're intentionally looking to query data of pending transactions (e.g. MEV bot) and prefer to immeditely get the pending tx data:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-ERPC-Retry-Pending: false' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params": [
        "0xe014f359cb3988f9944cd8003aac58812730383041993fdf762efcee21172d15",
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'

# OR
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161?retry-pending=false'
# ...
```

<Callout type="info">
    Pending transactions (with blockNumber of `null`) are not stored in [cache](/config/database/evm-json-rpc-cache) because they are not guaranteed to be included in any block.
</Callout>

You can set this directive on network-wide configuration so that it applies to all requests:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
projects:
  - id: main
    # To apply to all networks in this project:
    networkDefaults:
      directiveDefaults:
        retryPending: false # (default: true)
    
    # For a specific network:
    networks:
      - type: evm
        evm:
          chainId: 137
        directiveDefaults:
          retryPending: false # (default: true)

```

## Skip cache read

To instruct eRPC to skip 'reading' responses from cache, and make actual calls to upstreams. This directive is "false" by default, which means cache will be used.
Useful when you need to force-refresh some data or override an already cached response.

* Header `X-ERPC-Skip-Cache-Read: true`
* Or query parameter `?skip-cache-read=true`

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-ERPC-Skip-Cache-Read: true' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params": [
        "0xe014f359cb3988f9944cd8003aac58812730383041993fdf762efcee21172d15",
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'

# OR
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161?skip-cache-read=true'
# ...
```

> The new response will still be subject to caching as per usual.

## Cache max age

Specify the maximum age (in seconds) of a cached response you're willing to accept. If the cached response is older than this threshold, eRPC treats it as stale and fetches fresh data from upstreams.

* Header `X-ERPC-Cache-Max-Age: <seconds>`
* Or query parameter `?cache-max-age=<seconds>`

```bash
# Only accept cached responses that are less than 60 seconds old
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-ERPC-Cache-Max-Age: 60' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_call",
    "params": [
        {"to": "0x...", "data": "0x..."},
        "latest"
    ],
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'

# OR
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161?cache-max-age=60'
# ...
```

<Callout type="info">
  Cache max-age only applies to data with **realtime finality** (e.g., `latest` block queries). Finalized data is always served from cache regardless of the max-age directive, since finalized data is immutable.
</Callout>

### Cache age response headers

When a response is served from cache, eRPC includes headers to indicate the cache age:

- **`X-ERPC-Cache-Age`**: The age of the cached response in seconds (how long ago it was stored).
- **`X-ERPC-Cache-At`**: The Unix timestamp (seconds) when the response was originally cached.

These headers are only present when the response is served from cache.

```bash
# Example response headers for a cached response:
# X-ERPC-Cache: HIT
# X-ERPC-Cache-Age: 45
# X-ERPC-Cache-At: 1706000000
```

## Use specific upstream(s)

When sending requests to eRPC you can instruct to use only one specific upstream (or multiple via wildcard match) using:
* Header `X-ERPC-Use-Upstream: <xxx>` 
* Or query parameter `?use-upstream=<xxx>`

This will skip over any upstream that does not match the value you've provided.

<Callout type="info">
    You can use `*` as wildcard character to match a group of upstreams. e.g. "priv-*" will match any upstream IDs starting with "priv-"
</Callout>

For example if you want to make sure that request is sent to a specific upstream:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-ERPC-Use-Upstream: up123' \
--data '{
    "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
    "params": [
        "0xe014f359cb3988f9944cd8003aac58812730383041993fdf762efcee21172d15",
    ],
    "id": 9199,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}'

# OR
curl --location 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/42161?use-upstream=up123'
# ...
```

## Validation directives

For high-integrity use-cases (such as indexing) where data accuracy is critical, eRPC provides validation directives that check response structure and consistency. When validation fails, the response is rejected and retry/consensus policies automatically try other upstreams.

Examples of what you can validate:
- **Bloom filter consistency** — Ensure `logsBloom` matches actual logs in receipts
- **Receipt structure** — Validate transaction indices, log indices, hash uniqueness
- **Field formats** — Check header field lengths, transaction fields, log address/topic lengths
- and many more...

```bash
# Enable bloom validation for a single request
curl 'http://localhost:4000/main/evm/1?validate-logs-bloom-match=true' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"method": "eth_getBlockReceipts", "params": ["0x123"], "id": 1, "jsonrpc": "2.0"}'
```
