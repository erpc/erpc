# Rate limiters

To add self-imposed rate limits when sending requests to upstreams (RPS, Monthly, etc) you can define one or more rate limiter budgets.

A "budget" can be assigned to one or more upstreams, and those upstreams will share the usage of the budget.

### Config

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: blastapi-chain-42161
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://arbitrum-one.blastapi.io/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx
        rateLimitBudget: global-blast
        # ...
      - id: blastapi-chain-1
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://eth-mainnet.blastapi.io/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx
        rateLimitBudget: global-blast
        # ...
      - id: quiknode-chain-42161
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://xxxxxx-xxxxxx.arbitrum-mainnet.quiknode.pro/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/
        rateLimitBudget: global-quicknode
        # ...

# Rate limiter allows you to create "shared" budgets for upstreams.
# For example upstream A and B can use the same budget, which means both of them together must not exceed the defined limits.
rateLimiters:
  budgets:
    - id: global-blast
      rules:
        # You can limit which methods apply to this rule e.g. eth_getLogs or eth_* or * (all methods).
        - method: '*'
          maxCount: 1000
          period: 1s
    - id: global-quicknode
      rules:
        - method: '*'
          maxCount: 300
          period: 1s
```
