# Monitoring and metrics

Network-level and upstream-level metrics are available via [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

To enable metrics via config:
<Tabs items={["yaml", "typescript"]} defaultIndex={0} storageKey="GlobalConfigTypeTabIndex">
  <Tabs.Tab>
```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
metrics:
  enabled: true
  listenV4: true
  hostV4: "0.0.0.0"
  listenV6: false
  hostV6: "[::]"
  port: 4001
  errorLabelMode: "verbose" # Optional: "verbose" (default) or "compact"
  histogramBuckets: "0.01,0.1,0.5,1,5,10,60,300" # Optional: custom histogram buckets
```
</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="erpc.ts"
import { createConfig } from "@erpc-cloud/config";
 
export default createConfig({
  // ...
  metrics: {
    enabled: true,
    listenV4: true,
    hostV4: "0.0.0.0",
    listenV6: false,
    hostV6: "[::]",
    port: 4001,
    errorLabelMode: "verbose", // Optional: "verbose" (default) or "compact"
    histogramBuckets: "0.01,0.1,0.5,1,5,10,60,300", // Optional: custom histogram buckets
  }
});
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reducing Metrics Cardinality

eRPC provides two configuration options to help reduce metrics cardinality, which can significantly decrease the storage requirements and query performance of your monitoring system.

#### Error Label Mode

The `errorLabelMode` setting controls how detailed error information is included in metrics labels:

- `verbose`: Uses the full error message as labels (default for backward compatibility)
- `compact`: Uses only the error type as labels, reducing cardinality significantly
    
<Tabs items={["yaml", "typescript"]} defaultIndex={0} storageKey="GlobalConfigTypeTabIndex">
  <Tabs.Tab>
```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
metrics:
  errorLabelMode: "compact" # "verbose" or "compact"
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="erpc.ts"
metrics: {
  errorLabelMode: "compact", // "verbose" or "compact"
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Histogram Buckets

You can customize histogram buckets to reduce cardinality and focus on relevant latency ranges:

<Tabs items={["yaml", "typescript"]} defaultIndex={0} storageKey="GlobalConfigTypeTabIndex">
  <Tabs.Tab>
```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
metrics:
  histogramBuckets: "0.01,0.1,0.5,1,5,10,60,300"
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```ts filename="erpc.ts"
metrics: {
  histogramBuckets: "0.01,0.1,0.5,1,5,10,60,300",
}
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Setting fewer buckets or focusing on relevant latency ranges can significantly reduce the number of time series stored in your monitoring system.

Refer to [erpc/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/erpc/erpc/blob/main/docker-compose.yml#L4-L17) and [erpc/monitoring](https://github.com/erpc/erpc/tree/main/monitoring) for ready-made templates to bring up montoring.
