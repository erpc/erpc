# Upstreams

An upstream is defined to handle 1 or more networks (a.k.a. chains). There are currently these types of upstreams:

- [`evm`](#evm) A generic EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint. This is the default and most-used type.
- [`evm-alchemy`](#alchemy) A special upstream type that accepts Alchemy API-KEY and automatically adds all their EVM chains.

<Callout type='info'>
  eRPC supports any EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint when using `evm` type. Specialized types like "evm-alchemy" are built for well-known providers to make it easier to import "all supported evm chains" with just an API-KEY.
</Callout>

## Selection mechanism

eRPC records various metrics about each upstream, and uses them to decide which upstream to use when a request is made. These metrics include:
- 

## Config

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...

    # Each upstream supports 1 or more networks (i.e. evm chains)
    upstreams:
      - id: blastapi-chain-42161
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://arbitrum-one.blastapi.io/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxx

        # Defines which budget to use when hadnling requests of this upstream (e.g. to limit total RPS)
        # Since budgets can be applied to multiple upstreams they all consume from the same budget.
        # For example "global-blast" below can be applied to all chains supported by BlastAPI,
        # to ensure you're not hitting them more than your account allows.
        rateLimitBudget: global-blast

        # Defines which health check group config to use to decide this upstream is unhealthy.
        healthCheckGroup: default-hcg

        # chainId is optional and will be detected from the endpoint (eth_chainId),
        # but it is recommended to set it explicitly, for faster initialization.
        evm:
          chainId: 42161

        # Which methods must never be sent to this upstream.
        # For example this can be used to avoid archive calls (traces) to full nodes
        ignoreMethods:
          - "eth_traceTransaction"
          - "alchemy_*"

        # Refer to "Failsafe" section for more details:
        failsafe:
          timeout:
            duration: 15s
          retry:
            maxCount: 2
            delay: 1000ms
            backoffMaxDelay: 10s
            backoffFactor: 0.3
            jitter: 500ms
```

## Upstream Types

### `evm` JSON-RPC

These are generic well-known EVM-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints. This is the default and most-used type. They can be your own self-hosted nodes, or remote 3rd-party provider nodes.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: my-infura
        type: evm
        endpoint: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
        evm:
          chainId: 1 # Optional. If this is not set it'll be detected from the endpoint (eth_chainId)
          nodeType: full # Optional. Can be "full" or "archive"
        # ...
```

### `evm-alchemy` JSON-RPC

This upstream type is built specially for [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) 3rd-party provider to make it easier to import "all supported evm chains" with just an API-KEY.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
projects:
  - id: main
    # ...
    upstreams:
      - id: my-alchemy
        type: evm-alchemy # Optional. It will automatically detect this if the endpoint starts with "evm-alchemy://"
        endpoint: evm-alchemy://YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
        # ...
```

#### Roadmap

On some doc pages we like to share our ideas for related future implementations, feel free to open a PR if you're up for a challenge:

<br />- [ ] Add a "exclusiveMethods" to make it easier to configure which
upstreams are only ones supporting certain methods (e.g. alchemy_*) - [ ]
Automatically detect type of EVM nodes (full, archive) and engines (erigon,
geth, etc) - [ ] Implement the logic for "getLogsMaxBlockRange" to split
multiple requests when the block range is too high. - [ ] Add more special types
for well-known vendors (BlastAPI, Ankr, LlamaRPC, etc) for easier multi-chain
support.
