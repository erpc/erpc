# Database

Long-term storage is optional but used for various purposes such as caching, rate limit persistence, etc.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: memory | redis | postgresql | dynamodb
    # ... (driver specific config, see below)
```

### `evmJsonRpcCache`

This config defines the destination for caching JSON-RPC cals towards any EVM architecture upstream.
Caching mechanism is non-blocking on critical path, and is used as best-effort. If the database is not available, the cache set/get will be skipped.

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure the storage requirements meet your usage, for example caching 70m
  blocks + 10m txs + 10m traces on Arbitrum needs 200GB of storage.
</Callout>

#### Re-org mechanism

At the moment eRPC will track finalized block, only cache data for finalized blocks. This first version will ensure invalidation is not needed. In [future releases](https://erpc.featurebase.app/p/caching-un-finalized-data) it is planned to add capability to cache unfinalized data and invalidaiton re-org.

> For chains which do not support "finalized" block method, eRPC will consider last 1024 blocks unfinalized. This number is decided based on historical performance on real-world worst reorgs (e.g. on Polygon chain).

#### Cacheable methods
Methods are cached if they include a `blockNumber` or `blockHash` in the request or response, allowing cache invalidation during blockchain reorgs. If no blockNumber is present, caching is still viable if the method returns data unaffected by reorgs, like `eth_chainId`, or if the data won't change after a reorg, such as `eth_getTransactionReceipt`. Here is an overview of cacheable methods:

| Method Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                                           |

## Drivers

Depending on your use-case you can use different drivers.

### Memory

Mainly useful for local testing or when you don't need to cache too much data.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: memory
    maxItems: 10000
```

### Redis

Redis is useful when you need to store cached data temporarily with **eviction policy** (e.g. certain amount of memory).

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: redis
    redis:
      addr: YOUR_REDIS_ADDRESS_HERE
      password: YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD_HERE
      db: XXX
# ...
```

Example of Redis config with eviction policy:
```conf
maxmemory 2000mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
```

### PostgreSQL

Useful when you need to store cached data permanently without TTL i.e. forever.

<Callout type="info">
  You don't need to create the table, the driver will automatically create the
  table and requried indexes.
</Callout>

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: postgresql
    postgresql:
      connectionUri: >-
        postgres://YOUR_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@your.postgres.hostname.here.com:5432/your_database_name
      table: rpc_cache
# ...
```

### DynamoDB

When you need to have scalable (compared to Postgres) permanent caching and are happy with the costs.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: dynamodb
    dynamodb:
      table: rpc_cache
      region: eu-west-1
      endpoint: https://dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com # Optional
      # Auth is optional if you are running within AWS.
      auth:
        mode: secret # file, or env
        accessKeyId: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID # Only if mode is secret
        secretAccessKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY # Only if mode is secret
        profile: xxxxx # Only if mode is file
        credentialsFile: xxxx # Only if mode is file
```
