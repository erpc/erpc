# Networks

A network represents a chain in EVM, and it is a local grouping for upstreams.

<Callout>
  Requests to eRPC are targetted to a specific project and network (via URL), and handled by any upstream that supports this network.
</Callout>

You can configure failover behavior per network as follows:

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
networks:
  mainnet:
    upstreams:
      - "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_mainnet"
```
