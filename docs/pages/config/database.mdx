# Database

Long-term storage is optional but used for various purposes such as caching, rate limit persistence, etc.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache: # ...
```

### `evmJsonRpcCache`

This config defines the destination for caching JSON-RPC cals towards any EVM architecture upstream.
Caching mechanism is non-blocking on critical path, and is used as best-effort. If the database is not available, the cache set/get will be skipped.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure the storage requirements meet your usage, for example caching 70m blocks + 10m txs + 10m traces on Arbitrum needs 200GB of storage.
</Callout>


## Drivers

Depending on your use-case you can use different drivers.

### Memory

Mainly useful for local testing or when you don't need to cache too much data.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: memory
    maxItems: 10000
```

### Redis

Redis is useful when you need to store cached data temporarily with eviction policy (e.g. certain amount of memory).

### PostgreSQL

Useful when you need to store cached data permanently without TTL i.e. forever.

<Callout type="info">
You don't need to create the table, the driver will automatically create the table and requried indexes.
</Callout>

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: postgresql
    postgresql:
      connectionUri: >-
        postgres://YOUR_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@your.postgres.hostname.here.com:5432/your_database_name
      table: rpc_cache
# ...
```

### DynamoDB

When you need to have scalable (compared to Postgres) permanent caching and are happy with the costs.

```yaml filename="erpc.yaml"
# ...
database:
  evmJsonRpcCache:
    driver: dynamodb
    dynamodb:
      table: rpc_cache
      region: eu-west-1
      endpoint: https://dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com # Optional
      # Auth is optional if you are running within AWS.
      auth:
        mode: secret # file, or env
        accessKeyId: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID # Only if mode is secret
        secretAccessKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY # Only if mode is secret
        profile: xxxxx # Only if mode is file
        credentialsFile: xxxx # Only if mode is file
```
