[eRPC](https://erpc.cloud/) is a fault-tolerant EVM RPC proxy and re-org aware permanent caching solution. It is built with read-heavy use-cases in mind such as data indexing and high-load frontend usage.

![Architecture](./assets/hla-diagram.svg)

> ⚠️ eRPC is still under development, and for now should be used for "testnets" or as "a fallback" for RPC calls.

# Features

✅ Retries, circuit-breakers, [failovers](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/failsafe) and hedged requests make sure fastest most-reliable upstream is used <br/>
✅ Define hourly, daily [rate limits](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/rate-limiters) for each upstream provider, to control usage, costs and high-scale usage<br/>
✅ Avoid redundant upstream costs by locally [caching](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/database) RPC responses, with reorg-aware caching layer<br/>
✅ You don't need to think about which upstream supports which `eth_*` method; eRPC automatically does that.<br/>
✅ Receive consistent error codes with details across 5+ third-party providers and reporting of occured errors.<br/>
✅ Single dashboard to observe rps throughput, errors, and avg. latency of all your RPC providers.<br/>
✅ [Authentication](https://docs.erpc.cloud/config/auth) modules such as basic auth, secret-based, JWT and SIWE.<br/>
✅ [Smart batching](https://docs.erpc.cloud/operation/batch) to aggregates multiple RPC or contract calls into one.<br/>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erpc/erpc.git
```

2. Install Go dependencies:

```bash
make setup
```

3. Create a `erpc.yaml` configuration file based on the [`erpc.yaml.dist`](./erpc.yaml.dist) file, and use your RPC provider credentials:

```bash
cp erpc.yaml.dist erpc.yaml
vi erpc.yaml
```

4. Run the eRPC server:

```bash
make run
```
